# Ticket to Talk

Ticket to Talk is a cross platform application that aims to help encourage conversation between younger carers of those with dementia with those they are caring for. 
Users collect a series of ‘Tickets’ which they can use as prompts in conversations with who they are caring for. 
Tickets are media objects in the forms of pictures, sounds, and YouTube videos. 
Tickets are created in-app by selecting photos from the device’s library, taking new photos with the camera, or by using the microphone to record songs and sounds.

When using the app, the user will create a profile for themselves and, either: create a profile for who they want to talk to, or accept an invitation to contribute to an existing person if a profile has already been created. 
The tickets the user creates are attached to the person and shared between all those that contribute to the person. 
Each person is assigned an access level when they are invited and each ticket is also assigned one to help keep some sensitive data only between family and friends. 
When using the app, it may be difficult to create a library of tickets. 
To address this the app has an inspiration section, this provides prompts on what they can make tickets about, i.e. “Can you find a picture of Sarah’s old car?”. 
This helps the user build up a collection quickly.

To use the tickets as prompts the user is encouraged to create a ‘Conversation’. 
This is essentially a playlist which is given a date and time, a collection of tickets, and a notes section. 
Before the physical conversation the user would add a collection of tickets to the conversation and add some notes about what they want to talk about. 
This is so all of those using the application can see what the conversation is going to be about. 
During the physical conversation the user would press play and the tickets would be presented in a random order, where they can cycle through them at will. 
At the end of the conversation the user is prompted to update their notes on the conversation so other family members and carers can see how the interaction went. 
They can also use this to keep track of conversation topics that they found particularly successful.

The user can also save articles they or other users may find useful when dealing with dementia. 
They can make notes on these articles and share them with other users. 
They can also use this to save articles on interests of those they are talking about.

The app came to be after a series of workshops with younger carers of dementia as part of the DemYouth project. 
The idea comes from the participants concerns of not how to deal and approach someone with dementia but concerns of what to say in conversation with a grandparent or older relative where the inter-generational gap may mean a lack of common interests.
